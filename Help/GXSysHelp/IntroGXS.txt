GLXEngine is an OpenGL based collector for Delphi and C++Builder packages. 
It provides visual components and objects allowing description and effective rendering of 3D scenes.
GLXEngine is not only an OpenGL wrapper or utility library, but it's grown to become a set of founding classes 
for a generic 3D engine for the Rapid Application Development. 
GLXEngine allows you to design and render 3D scenes quickly and without having to learn the intricacies of OpenGL: 
if you know how to design a TForm, you'll easily master the basic operation of TgxScene. 
Make sure to checkout the introduction tutorial included in the help folder.
GLXEngine includes more than many components and a variety of founding classes. 
The library comes with a comfortable set of demos showcasing the ease of use and demonstrating RAD wasn't done 
at the expense of CPU horsepower. 
The GLXEngine Sound System allows positional 3D audio via low-level APIs like 
FMOD, BASS, OpenAL and WaveOut.
Advanced demos and samples could be found in the project directory GLXEngine\Examples.
Some additional options for compiler are in GLScene.Defines.inc (activated/deactivated, all are inactive by default):
The option DEFINE Graphics32_SUPPORT controls support Alex Denissov's Graphics32 library 
(http://www.graphics32.org), once activated will redirect assignments from TBitmap32 to TGLBitmap32.

GLXEngine is a graphical package collector for Delphi and C++Builder.
It provides components and objects for fast and efficient rendering of 3D scenes.
GLXEngine allows you to quickly design and visualize 3D scenes without learning the intricacies of OpenGL or Vulkan:

If you know how to design with VCL/FMX, you'll easily master the basic functions of GLScene and GXScene.
Be sure to read the installation instruction and introductory guide included in the help folder.
GLXEngine includes numerous components and base classes.
The GLXEngine sound system enables positional 3D sound playback through low-level APIs with FMOD, BASS, OpenAL, and WaveOut.
The library includes a convenient set of demo examples. Advanced demos and examples can be found in the GLXEngine\Examples project directory. 
Some additional compiler options are found in GLScene.Defines.inc (enabled/disabled):
The DEFINE Graphics32_SUPPORT option supports Graphics32 library (http://www.graphics32.org). 
When enabled, it redirects mappings from TBitmap32 to TGLBitmap32.
